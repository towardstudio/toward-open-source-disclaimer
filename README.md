Hello. We’re Toward. We’re providing this repository for you to do with as you please. Feel free to use this software, prose or whatever-it-is in accordance with the license provided. If we provided no license, fantastic. I guess you can do what you like with it.

However, do not expect us to support this repository or your use of it. We built this for us to use at a specific point in time and are unlikely to respond to support requests or to fix your specific issues, unless we feel like it would be of use to us. That sounds a bit selfish, but we have work to do and kids to feed. Soz. If you’re really stuck, you could always hire us

We take no responsibility for anything positive or negative that happens as a result of releasing, or your use of, this. If this for any reason breaks your, your boss’ or your friend’s computer, unlucky. If by installing this you unlock the seventh seal and unleash 100 years of darkness upon the earth (or any habitable terrestrial or celestial object) - tough-titties. No-givesies-backsies.
Enjoy :v:

P.S. If the open source project in question is this disclaimer, then this disclaimer should serve as the disclaimer for the disclaimer. Very meta.
